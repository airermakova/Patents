Teenager body monitoring system and method based on thermal imaging technology
Abstract
The invention relates to a teenager body monitoring system and method based on a thermal imaging technology. The system comprises a smart sound box which is mounted in a room and is used for receivinguser voices in the room; a camera which is used for obtaining a face image of a teenager; a thermal imager which is mounted in the room and is used for obtaining an infrared thermal image of the teenager; a display screen which is used for displaying a marked infrared thermal image; a memory which is used for storing the infrared thermal images of a plurality of teenagers; and a controller whichis used for communicating with the smart sound box, the camera, the thermal imager, the display screen and the memory. According to the system and the method, the infrared thermal image of the teenager is obtained through the thermal imager, the infrared thermal image is compared with the infrared thermal images of the teenagers in normal states, pain points possibly existing in certain locationsof the teenager can be preliminarily judged, the interaction with the teenager is carried out through utilization of the smart sound box, to-be-confirmed paint points are confirmed with the teenager through the display screen, and the body condition of the teenager can be accurately learned before exercise.
