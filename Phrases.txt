invention refers to medicine, namely to traumatology and orthopaedics, and can be used for diagnosing dynamic imbalance of quadriceps muscle of thigh as a result of lateral dislocation of a patella. Performing surface electroneuromyography is performed. ENMG-examination is related to phase of the step. In determining additional reduction m. vastus medialis of quadriceps muscle in range of 60â€“80 % of step cycle is diagnosed by imbalance m. vastus medialis of quadriceps muscle of thigh as a result of lateral position patella.EFFECT: method enables improving the therapy on the basis of objective criteria by determining in real time the occurrence of a modified walking stereotype.1 cl, 4 dwg
